## What You‚Äôll Practice
- Adding IoT devices and controllers in Packet Tracer
- Basic automation logic and event conditions
- Verifying connectivity and telemetry

## Scenario Index

| # | Scenario | Concepts | File |
|---|----------|----------|------|
| 1 | Smart Room Basics | Sensor/actuator pairing, controller setup | [IoT1_SmartRoom.pkt](./IoT1_SmartRoom.pkt) |
| 2 | Environmental Monitor | Temp/humidity sensors, thresholds, alerts | [IoT2_EnvMonitor.pkt](./IoT2_EnvMonitor.pkt) |
| 3 | Access Control | Door sensor, camera trigger, notification flow | [IoT3_AccessControl.pkt](./IoT3_AccessControl.pkt) |

## Evidence to Capture
- Topology screenshot with labels
- Controller/thing configuration screenshots
- Event logs showing triggers and actions
- Brief rationale for thresholds/logic

**File naming:** `LastName_FirstName_IoTNN`

## Common Pitfalls
- Devices not powered/connected
- Controller not bound to the correct network
- Missing credentials/keys between devices
- Event conditions never satisfied (test with forced values)
