# Cisco Packet Tracer Labs

Core Packet Tracer activities used throughout the course.

**Navigation:** [🏠 Home](../index.md) • [🧰 Networking](../Networking/README.md) • [🌐 IoT](../IoT/README.md)

---

## Prerequisites
- Cisco Packet Tracer (current version recommended by instructor)
- Basic CLI familiarity (enable, config t, interface, vlan, ip address)

---



## Deliverables (Default)
Submit your **`.pkt`** file plus a brief write-up (`PDF`/`MD`) with:
- IP/VLAN plan table and key config snippets
- Verification output (`show ip int br`, `show vlan brief`, `show ip route`, `ping`)
- 2–3 issues encountered and how you resolved them

**File naming:** `LastName_FirstName_LabNN`

---

## Troubleshooting
- Interfaces up? `show ip int br`
- Correct access/trunk modes and VLANs?
- Default gateways on hosts?
- Routes advertised and visible? `show ip route`
- No IP overlaps or ACL blocks?
