## What You‚Äôll Practice
- Adding IoT devices and controllers in Packet Tracer
- Basic automation logic and event conditions
- Verifying connectivity and telemetry

## Evidence to Capture
- Topology screenshot with labels
- Controller/thing configuration screenshots
- Event logs showing triggers and actions
- Brief rationale for thresholds/logic

**File naming:** `LastName_FirstName_IoTNN`

## Common Pitfalls
- Devices not powered/connected
- Controller not bound to the correct network
- Missing credentials/keys between devices
- Event conditions never satisfied (test with forced values)
